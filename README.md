# MATLAB
Family Time 3D Animation using MATLAB.
I could not share the virtual world file because it is too big. I hope you have an idea of what
it takes to develop 3d animation using MATLAB.
Open the simulink model in Simulink and see how I implemented the functions for the various nodes/objects in the
virtual world environment.
